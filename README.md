 Objective
The goal of this assignment was to create a program calculates and informs you your birth year basing on the age and create a class with it's attributes using a constructer for initializing the parameters.

Development:
- Ian: Worked on the class funtion.
- Mesha: Worked on the sort function .
- Anthlem: Worked on the creativity and search function.

Class: “Book” Purpose. 
The “Book”class is designed to represent a book with its essential attributes.

sort_books_by_year(books) method; 
Purpose: This function is responsible for sorting a list of Book objects based on the year_published attribute.

Sorting Mechanism: 
The function uses “sorted()” with a lambda function as its key. The lambda function extracts the `year_published` attribute from each Book object for sorting.

Challenges:
Faced issues with creating functions that involved iterations especially those outside the class.

 Advanced Looping; 
Searching for a Book:
The program allows the user to search for a book by its title.
A while loop prompts the user for input continually until they enter exit; to stop the search.

Error handling:
User Input Validation:
When the program prompts the user for their age and favorite number, it wraps this
functionality in a try-except block to handle potential ValueError. This occurs specifically
when the user inputs non-numeric values. If an error is caught, the program prints a message
informing the user to enter a valid number, which enhances the user experience by preventing the program from crashing.

 Conclusion; 
The project successfully met its objectives, providing user input using functions to avoid repetitions.
